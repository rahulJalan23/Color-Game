# Color Game

    The webpage shows a RGB value on top.
    The user has to choose the right color from the colors displayed below.

    A simple yet fun site to get practice with the RGB values.
    A great way for getting better to create color values while designing.

    The browser uses dom functions to create an interactive webpage.

    ThankYou.
